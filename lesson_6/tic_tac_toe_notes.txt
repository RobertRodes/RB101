Hand total calculation algorithm.

Add all values in hand: 
  -  10, J, Q, K all count as 10
  -  A counts 11
  -  Everything else counts face value

If sum is greater than 21:
  -  Subtract 10 if there is an A in hand.
  -  Repeat for each A in hand until sum is less than or equal to 21.
  -  If sum is still greater than 21, bust.
